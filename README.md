# Android - TRMNL Display
A simple app to mirror existing TRMNL's content to your Android device (preferably e-ink display).

## üìú Preconditions
You must have a **valid** `access-token` to access the [screen content](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/private-api/fetch-screen-content) using TRMNL server API.

Here are some of the known ways you can get access to the `access-token`.

1. You must own a terminal device with "developer edition" add-on purchased
2. You have purchased their [BYOD](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byod)* product. (Not confirmed if you also need to buy "developer edition" add-on)
3. You have self-serve installation of TRMNL service using [BYOS](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos) (Not confirmed if this works - I plan to try this later)


## How to try
Once released, install the APK on your Android device.

1. Configure the `access-token`  
    i. üìù NOTE: Right now only `https://usetrmnl.com/api` service API is supported, custom service URL will be added later
3. Save token and keep the app on with the TRMNL content/image showing.

### Limitations üöß
* Right now, screen lock using [recommended](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/awake/screen-on) **`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`** is not working. So, if you plan to keep the screen on idefinitely, you should set that in the device settings.
